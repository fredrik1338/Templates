## Creating a Plan

When starting new work, create a plan file with:

1. **Feature Description** - What the feature does
2. **Requirements** - What needs to be achieved
3. **Implementation Steps** - Ordered list of tasks
4. **Open Questions** - Things to clarify with the human

## Plan Lifecycle

1. Create plan in `plans/`
2. Get human approval
3. Update plan as work progresses
4. When fully complete, move to `implemented/`

## Important

- **Partially completed plans stay in `plans/`** - update them in place
- **Only fully implemented plans go to `implemented/`**
- Mark completed steps as you go
- Note any deviations from the original plan
